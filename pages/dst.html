<p class="drop">
	The <b>daylight savings time (DST)</b> is the practice of advancing clocks to make better use of the longer daylight available during summer so that darkness falls at a later clock time.
</p>

<p>
	The standard implementation of DST is to set clocks forward by one hour in spring or late winter, and to set clocks back by one hour to standard time in the autumn (fall, hence the mnemonic: 'spring forward and fall back')
</p>

<p>
	In several countries, the number of weeks when DST is observed is much longer than the number devoted to standard time.

<p>P.S. time is much more complicated than I thought</p>
